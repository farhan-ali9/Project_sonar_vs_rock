# Rock vs Mine Classification (Sonar Dataset)

Hi there! 👋  
This is a small machine learning project where we try to **classify sonar signals** as either a **rock** or a **metal mine** using the famous Sonar dataset from UCI.

## 📁 What’s in this project
- **project_rock_vs_mine.ipynb**: My Jupyter Notebook where I explore the data, train models, and check how well they perform.  
- **sonar.csv**: The dataset used to train and test the model.  
- **sonar.names.txt**: A description of the dataset and its features.  

## 🎯 Project Goal
The goal is simple: build a model that can **correctly tell if a sonar reading is from a rock or a mine**. This is a great way to practice classification, preprocessing, and model evaluation.

## How I did it
- Cleaned and preprocessed the data  
- Split the data into training and testing sets  
- Tried different machine learning models like **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest**  
- Evaluated the models using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports  

## 📊 Results
After training the models, I was able to see:  
- Accuracy scores for each model  
- Confusion matrices to check where the model makes mistakes  
- Detailed classification reports  

## 🚀 How to run this project
1. Clone this repository:  
```bash
